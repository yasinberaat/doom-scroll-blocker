# Doom Scroll Blocker - Project Brief

## Project Overview
A React Native (Expo) application designed to break the dopamine loop of social media scrolling through timed interventions every 15-20 minutes.

## Core Requirements
- **Goal**: Create awareness and interrupt unconscious social media usage patterns
- **Approach**: Non-blocking interventions that interrupt rather than completely ban usage
- **Timing**: Interventions every 15-20 minutes of continuous social media usage
- **Platform**: React Native with Expo framework
- **Design**: Cyberpunk aesthetic with dark mode and neon warnings

## Key Features
1. **Usage Monitoring**: Track social media app usage patterns
2. **Timed Interventions**: Trigger awareness prompts every 15-20 minutes
3. **Cyberpunk UI**: Dark mode with neon accent colors and warnings
4. **Non-Intrusive**: Interventions that create awareness without blocking access
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn user habits and optimize intervention timing

## Success Criteria
- Users report increased awareness of social media usage
- Reduction in continuous scrolling sessions
- Positive user retention (app remains useful, not annoying)
- Effective intervention timing based on usage patterns

## Constraints
- Expo framework limitations for system-wide overlays
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Battery efficiency for background monitoring
- User privacy and data protection

# Doom Scroll Blocker - Product Context

## Problem Statement
Social media platforms are designed to create dopamine loops that keep users scrolling indefinitely. Users often lose track of time and fall into unconscious scrolling patterns, leading to:
- Reduced productivity
- Mental health impacts
- Sleep disruption
- Loss of intentional technology use

## Solution Philosophy
Instead of completely blocking social media (which often leads to users disabling the app), we focus on:
- **Awareness Creation**: Making users conscious of their usage patterns
- **Pattern Interruption**: Breaking the automatic scrolling behavior
- **Gentle Nudges**: Non-aggressive interventions that prompt reflection
- **Habit Reformation**: Helping users build more intentional usage habits

## User Experience Goals
1. **Seamless Integration**: Works in the background without constant attention
2. **Minimal Friction**: Interventions are quick to dismiss but impactful
3. **Visual Impact**: Cyberpunk aesthetic creates memorable, attention-grabbing moments
4. **Empowerment**: Users feel in control, not restricted
5. **Insightful Analytics**: Users understand their usage patterns

## Target User Profile
- Social media users who want to reduce mindless scrolling
- People aware of their digital habits but struggle to change them
- Users who prefer gentle guidance over strict restrictions
- Individuals comfortable with technology and data tracking

## Intervention Strategy
- **Timing**: 15-20 minutes based on research about attention spans
- **Method**: Full-screen overlays or prominent notifications
- **Content**: Thought-provoking questions, usage statistics, or breathing exercises
- **Design**: Cyberpunk warnings that feel futuristic and engaging
- **Dismissal**: Easy to dismiss but requires conscious action

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: Users keep the app enabled for extended periods
- **Behavior Change**: Reduction in continuous scrolling sessions
- **Self-Reported Awareness**: Users feel more conscious of their usage
- **Retention**: Low uninstall rates compared to blocking apps
